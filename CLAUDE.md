# Creative Klux — Frontend

This document gives an AI coding assistant the context it needs to be productive in this repo from the first message. Keep it current; if you make architectural changes or learn something non-obvious, update the relevant section.

## What this app is

Creative Klux is an AI-powered creative/marketing platform for creators, managers, and brands. The product offers brand management, AI design generation (ads, social, designer, magic studio), image editing, social/ad publishing, analytics, and integrations.

This repo is **frontend only**. The backend is a separate Laravel service.

## Tech stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4
- **State:** React Context (no Redux/Zustand)
- **HTTP:** `fetch` (mostly) + `axios` (a little, in `src/app/api/axios.js`)
- **Toasts:** `sonner`
- **Charts:** `apexcharts` + `recharts` (both installed; both in use)
- **Animation:** `framer-motion`
- **Image tooling:** `react-image-crop`, `react-rnd` (canvas editor), `@imgly/background-removal`
- **Routing helper:** `react-router-dom` is installed but the app uses Next's `next/navigation`

No TypeScript. Files are `.js` / `.jsx`.

## Backend

- **Base URL:** `https://api.creativeklux.com/api/creativeklux-userend`
- **Hosted at:** `api.creativeklux.com` (separate Laravel project, not in this repo)
- **Auth:** Bearer token in `Authorization` header. Token stored in `localStorage` under `"token"`.
- **Laravel quirk:** PUT requests are sent as `POST` with `_method=PUT` in `FormData` (see `updateBrandById` in `AuthContext.jsx`).

## Architecture overview

### Route groups (Next App Router)

Folders in `()` are organizational — they don't appear in URLs.

```
src/app/
  layout.js              Root layout (server component, mounts providers + Toaster)
  globals.css
  (auth)/                Login, register, verify-email, forgot/change password
    layout.jsx           ← do NOT add an AuthProvider here (see "Provider duplication" below)
  (dashboard)/           Authenticated app
    layout.js            Sidebar + Header + ProtectedRoute + brand-picker modal
    (pages)/             Feature pages, grouped by domain:
      (analyze)/         brandPulse, creativeIQ
      (Predict)/         adGuard, rivalLens
      (ads-content)/     ads-analytics, ads-calendar, ads-publishing
      (social-content)/  social-analytics, social-calendar, social-publishing
      (settings)/        profile, billing, team, sessions-and-password, socials, ads, etc.
      brand/             create, edit, import, reuse (Brand Kits)
      studio/, magic-studio/, product-photos/, image-gallery/, …
  (components)/          Shared UI (~50 files): Sidebar, Header, Modal, ImageGallery, etc.
  api/                   BFF route handlers for OAuth + media proxy:
                         google, meta, linkedin, twitter, pinterest, pexels,
                         proxy-image, proxy-media
```

### Providers (root layout)

```
RootLayout
  └─ AuthProvider          ← src/context/AuthContext.jsx
       └─ BrandProvider    ← src/context/BrandContext.jsx (different from AuthContext.brands!)
            └─ ReusableFunctionsProvider
                 └─ children
  + <Toaster />            ← sonner, mounted in body
```

### Why "frontend with a tiny BFF"

This is a SPA that talks directly to `api.creativeklux.com` for almost everything. The only server-side Next routes are `src/app/api/*` — they exist for OAuth code/token exchanges (need server-side client secrets) and media proxying (CORS / hiding source URLs). Everything else is browser → Laravel.

## State / data — `AuthContext.jsx` is the heart

`src/context/AuthContext.jsx` is ~2,500 lines. It is BOTH the auth context AND the project's API client. It owns:

- `user`, `token`, `loading`
- `brands`, `brandsLoading`, `activeBrand`, `activeBrandId`
- `teams`, `teamsLoading`
- `myImages`, `myImagesLoading`
- `tutorialVideos`, `tutorialVideosLoading`, `tutorialVideosError`
- `socialAccounts`

And exposes ~30+ methods: `login`, `register`, `verifyEmail`, `resendVerificationCode`, `logout`, brand CRUD (`createBrand`, `createManualBrand`, `fetchBrands`, `fetchBrandById`, `updateBrandById`, `deleteBrandById`, `setActiveBrand`), team management, resells, social/ad account connect+disconnect, image gallery, design save/fetch/update/delete, `analyzeRival`, `getCompetitorInsights`, `checkCompliance`, `creativeScoring`, `creativeInsights`, `saveIntegration`, `runComparison`, `fetchDesignTemplates`, `creativeAiChat`, `generateCustomCreative`, etc.

### `authFetch` wrapper

All authenticated calls should go through `authFetch` (defined inside `AuthProvider`). It auto-logs the user out on 401 (clears `localStorage` + state, throws `"Unauthorized"`). If you call `fetch` directly with a Bearer token, you bypass that safety net.

### `BrandContext.jsx` (the *other* brands context)

There is a second context called `BrandContext` that ALSO tracks `brands` / `activeBrand` — but its data comes from a local IndexedDB-like store (`@/utils/localDb`), not the API. It uses `localStorage.getItem("activeBrand")` (different key from AuthContext's `"activeBrandId"`). The dashboard layout's modal logic uses `useAuth()`, not `useBrand()`. Treat `BrandContext` as legacy unless you find a place that needs it; new code should pull brand state from `AuthContext`.

## Auth flow

1. Tokens kept in `localStorage` (`token`, `user`, `activeBrandId`). Registration uses `sessionStorage` for `pendingUserId`, `pendingEmail`, `pendingName`.
2. `AuthProvider` mount effect reads `token` from `localStorage`. If present, restores it; a `[token]` effect then calls `fetchProfile` + `fetchBrands` + `fetchTeams` + `fetchMyImages` + `fetchTutorialVideos` in parallel.
3. Every authenticated call goes through `authFetch` → 401 forces logout.
4. `ProtectedRoute` (in `src/app/(components)/ProtectedRoutes.js`) gates `(dashboard)/*`. It also reads `localStorage` directly as a fallback, so the dashboard renders even before `user` state is hydrated.
5. After login, `(dashboard)/layout.js` shows a brand-picker modal if the user has brands but none is active (`brands.length > 0 && !activeBrand`).

### Provider duplication — fixed, don't reintroduce

There used to be **two `AuthProvider` instances** — one in the root layout and one in `(auth)/layout.jsx`. The login form mutated the inner one, which was destroyed on navigation to `/`, so the brand-picker modal didn't show until the user refreshed. The duplicate has been removed. **Do not re-add `<AuthProvider>` to any `(auth)` layout** — there must be exactly one `AuthProvider` in the tree, in the root layout.

## Conventions / patterns to follow

- **Client components** liberally — `"use client"` at top of any file using hooks/state.
- **Field naming:** backend uses snake_case (`primary_color`, `created_at`); we use those names directly in components. No mapping layer.
- **Status field:** the backend `brand.status` (0/1) does NOT mean "is the user's active brand". The active brand is tracked in `useAuth().activeBrandId`. On Brand Kits, the "Active" badge reflects `brand.id === activeBrandId`, not `status`.
- **Toaster:** use `import { toast } from "sonner"` for user-facing errors/success. The `<Toaster />` is mounted in the root layout (top-right, `richColors`).
- **Routing:** `useRouter()` from `next/navigation`, `router.push(...)` for navigation.
- **No TypeScript** — don't introduce `.ts`/`.tsx` files unless asked.
- **Don't bypass `authFetch`** — always use it for authenticated requests so 401 logout works.

## Confirmed brand object shape (from the API)

```js
{
  id, user_id, name, description, tagline,
  logo,                    // full https URL
  primary_color,           // hex string
  secondary_color,         // hex string
  fonts,                   // string, e.g. "Inter"
  url,                     // brand website
  industry,                // string
  status,                  // 0 or 1 (backend-controlled; not the same as "currently active")
  created_at, updated_at,  // ISO strings
}
```

Wrapper response: `{ success, message, data: [ ...brands ] }`.

## Known quirks / things to watch

- `apexcharts` AND `recharts` are both installed. Different pages use different libraries.
- `react-router-dom` is in `package.json` but the app uses `next/navigation`. Probably leftover from migration.
- A backup file `src/app/(auth)/login/login.backup.jsx` exists alongside `page.jsx`. Don't import it.
- Several `.DS_Store` files are committed in `src/` — macOS noise.
- Some `useEffect`s in `AuthContext` use `[token]` deps; the mount effect uses `[]` and ONLY runs once on first render. Don't rely on it re-running.
- `BASE_URL` is hardcoded in `AuthContext` — no env var. If switching environments, edit it directly.

## Recent significant changes

(Last updated 2026-05-22. Keep this short — a running 3–5 item list is fine.)

- **Removed duplicate `AuthProvider`** from `(auth)/layout.jsx`. Fixed the brand-picker modal not appearing after login.
- **Brand Kits page (`/brand/reuse`)** wired to the real API. It was previously rendering 4 hardcoded mock brands. Now uses `useAuth().brands` and `deleteBrandById` (real delete).
- **Mounted `<Toaster />`** in the root layout. Several existing `toast.success/error` calls scattered across the app were previously silent because there was no host.
- **`fetchBrands` shows a toast** on JSON-parse, non-2xx, and network errors (skipping 401 since user is being logged out anyway).
- The "Active" badge on Brand Kits now reflects `brand.id === activeBrandId` instead of `brand.status === 1`.

## Where the bodies are buried

- **Sidebar entries** (the canonical list of feature routes) — `src/app/(components)/Sidebar.jsx`
- **Modal that forces brand selection** — `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.js` (renders `ModalPage` based on `useAuth()`)
- **Brand-picker modal component** — `src/app/(components)/ModalPage.jsx`
- **OAuth helpers** — `src/(lib)/oauth.js`, `src/(lib)/oauth/page.jsx`, `src/(lib)/integrations/platformResolvers.js`
- **Mock data** still around — `src/data/mockBrands.js`, `mockProducts.js`, `assetsData.js`. Some pages may still use these; prefer real API.

## Running locally

```
npm run dev      # next dev
npm run build    # next build
npm run start    # next start
npm run lint     # next lint
```

There is no `.env.example`. The `BASE_URL` and other endpoints are hardcoded in `AuthContext.jsx`.
